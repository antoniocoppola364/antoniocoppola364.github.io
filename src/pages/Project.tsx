                <h3>Short Description</h3>

                <p>
                    The STEAM project aims to analyze and design future vehicle usage concepts for passenger and freight
                    transport in a holistic and user-centered manner. These vehicle utilization concepts leverage the
                    potential of use in times of low demand, which results from the intersection of individual, public,
                    and freight transport and their optimal use. <br/><br/>

                    To this end, the current bus network will be supplemented by minibuses, taking into account
                    individual user and usage requirements to be identified in the project, and thus made more
                    flexible and efficient. The resulting semi-flexible bus routes will efficiently serve the
                    demand for mobility in the peak and off-peak hours of traditional scheduled services in a
                    demand-driven manner and could also cover part of the city logistics. In order to achieve
                    the project objectives, the project comprises (i) the design and simulative testing of
                    semi-flexible bus lines, (ii) the prospective integration of urban delivery traffic
                    (e.g. courier, express, and parcel services) into semi-flexible lines, (iii)
                    the development of a suitable modular vehicle utilization concept and (iv)
                    the validation of the simulations and the testing of the vehicle utilization
                    concepts in a real-world laboratory. <br/><br/>

                    Finally, concrete recommendations for action will be derived from the combination
                    of the simulations and the real-world laboratory - experimental cooperation between
                    science and society - with the aim of designing a long-term and sustainable development
                    option for urban mobility in Munich and other metropolitan regions.
                    The project partners and other stakeholders will iteratively derive requirements for
                    future vehicles and their interiors during the project based on the validated
                    and tested findings. In addition, the holistic, user-centered approach enables
                    innovative operating concepts and, thus, business models to be designed and analyzed.
                    The consortium of industry, business, and local authorities can put the findings into practice and
                    thus significantly improve the quality of air, time, and space within the M Cube Cluster and beyond.
