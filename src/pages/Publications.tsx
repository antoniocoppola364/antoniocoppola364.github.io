                In this interdisciplinary project, a student developed a comprehensive model to generate passenger demand for public transportation, leveraging data provided by Stadtwerke MÃ¼nchen (SWM). Utilizing General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, he extracted and analyzed stop information for specific bus routes. The methodology involved creating stochastic Origin-Destination (OD) matrices based on average passenger movements, with enhancements through iterative proportional fitting and mapping to nearby buildings within a specified radius, thereby simulating realistic passenger trips.
